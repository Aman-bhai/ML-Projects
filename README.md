# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of small machine learning projects developed using Python. Each project demonstrates different aspects of machine learning, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Projects

### 1. Fake News Detection
This project aims to detect misleading or false news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

- **Tech Stack**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NLTK
- **Objective**: Build a classification model that distinguishes between real and fake news articles.
- **Key Features**:
  - Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
  - Feature extraction using TF-IDF
  - Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
  - Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
This project analyzes the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in text data, such as product reviews or social media posts.

- **Tech Stack**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NLTK
- **Objective**: Classify text data based on the sentiment expressed.
- **Key Features**:
  - Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
  - Feature extraction using TF-IDF or word embeddings
  - Model training using algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.
  - Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aman-bhai/ml-projects.git
   cd ml-projects
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   - python -m venv venv
   - source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install the required Python packages:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
- Navigate to the respective project directory:

### bash
Copy code
cd fake-news-detection
or

### bash
Copy code
cd sentiment-analysis
Run the project scripts:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Modify the scripts to test with different datasets or models.

## Data
- Fake News Detection: Uses a dataset containing real and fake news articles,These project may or may not gives the good result as it is only trainned only on single dataset collected from Kaggle and might be underfitted. 
- Sentiment Analysis: Uses a dataset of text data with labeled sentiments. These project may or may not gives the good result as it is only trainned only on single dataset collected from Kaggle and might be underfitted.
Results
Each project includes performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's effectiveness.
